Prerequisite: STT 3851

**Course Catelog Description:**  

This course serves as a continuation of STT 3851 (Statistical Learning I). Fundamentals of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) are explored, with a focus on the Linear exponential family, the Link function, and their applications to categorical and count response variables. Supervised learning techniques for classification models and tree-based methods are also examined, as they apply to both regression and classification problems. Unsupervised learning is introduced, including principal component analysis and various clustering algorithms. Other topics such as support vector machines, regression splines, and smoothing splines may be included. Students will complete projects using methods and algorithms covered in class and report their results using professional editing tools that use principles of reproducible statistical research.


**Learning Outcomes**  

At the completion of this course, students will be able to: 

  * Understand key concepts of statistical learning and the R programming language. 
  
  * Explain models in R and access and interpret output, including diagnostics.
  
  * Understand the key concepts concerning the construction of generalized linear models.  
  
  * Apply the key concepts concerning principal components analysis. 
  
  * Apply the key concepts concerning decision tree models.  
  
  * Apply the key concepts concerning cluster analysis. 
  
  * Write reports and explain findings related to models and code. 


**Course Text:**

 *  Introduction to Statistical Learning, by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie, and R. Tibshirani (available as pdf download) (referred to as ISLR below) (7th Edition)    http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/                
 
 *  Regression Modeling with Actuarial and Financial Applications, Edward W. Frees, 2010, New York: Cambridge. ISBN: 978-0521135962 


**Required Resources:**

Text book, Computer with access to the RStudio server (provided), Note book, notes,  pencil and  a calculator

 **Homework:** Students are expected to work all assigned problems. Only selected assignments or parts of assignments may at times be graded. See schedule for the dates.

**Quizzes:** I anticipate giving weekly quizzes during the semester. See schedule for the dates. 
<!--The lowest quiz grade will be
dropped when determining the final grade.-->

**Tests/ Projects:** One mid exam and a project will be given. See schedule for the dates. 


**Final Exam:** A final exam will be given on TBA. This final exam will be comprehensive, covering all material that is covered in the course. As the final exam needs to be proctored you are required to have your video camera on during the final exam time.

**Attendance and participation:** 

Attendance will be taken at the end of each class. Students are expected to attend every class. A detailed description of the ASU attendance policy can be found at the following link, [https://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi-policy-and-statement-information]


**Course Grading:**

  * 20% of the grade will come from Homework.
  * 30% of the course grade will come from Quizzes.
  * 15% of the grade will come from project.
  * 15% of the grade will come from the Mid-Exam.
  * 20% of the grade will come from the Final-Exam.
